      "content": "Atomic orbitals are regions of space around an atom's nucleus where electrons are most likely to be found. **Quantum mechanics** provides the theoretical framework for understanding atomic orbitals. According to this theory, electrons can only occupy certain energy levels, or **quantum states**. These energy levels are described by a set of four quantum numbers: the principal quantum number, azimuthal quantum number, magnetic quantum number, and spin quantum number. \n\n![Atomic orbitals](atomic-orbital-2)\n\nThe shapes of atomic orbitals are determined by their quantum numbers. The principal quantum number determines the orbital's energy level and size, while the azimuthal quantum number determines the orbital's shape. The magnetic quantum number determines the orbital's orientation in space. \n\nIn summary, atomic orbitals are essential to understanding the behavior of electrons in atoms. They play a crucial role in chemical bonding and the formation of molecules. "
