Atomizer is a state-of-the-art SwiftUI app that visualizes atomic and molecular orbitals.
It features atomic orbitals in the form of electron density, and molecular orbitals in which you can view it in AR.

- ARKit and SceneKit are used to render the 3D models. Object occlusion is also supported on LiDAR-enabled devices.

- Using Apple's powerful ML-trained Vision framework, I was able to achieve object spawning by hand detection,
in which the molecule will come right into your hand like Thor's hammer, all in Augmented Reality.

- For the electron coordinate data, it uses the ElectronVisualized API I created from scratch by myself, using Python and Flask.

- I used ASE and GPAW to get electron density data, using Density Functional Theory (DFT).
For the molecular orbitals, I used PySCF to get the molecular orbitals, using Hartreeâ€“Fock (HF) theory.

- For atomic orbitals, I used the spherical harmonics to compute the radial part of the atomic orbitals.
Then, I sampled the wavefunction by using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
